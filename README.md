# scikit-learn Contributor Experience Team

On 16 October 2025, [Reshama Shaikh](https://github.com/reshamas), [Stefanie Senger](https://github.com/StefanieSenger), and I gave a talk titled **"scikit-learn Contributor Experience Team"** for the Birdaro Training Program, 
organised by the Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement (CSCCE).

The talk focused on scikit-learn's Contributor Experience Team, particularly its role in making the contribution process smoother for first-time contributors.
